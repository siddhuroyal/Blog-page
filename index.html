                    <p>Machine learning (ML) basics for beginners involve understanding it as a field of AI where systems learn from data to make predictions without explicit programming. The core process involves gathering and preparing data, choosing an algorithm, training the model, and evaluating its performance. Key types of machine learning include supervised (labeled data), unsupervised (unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (trial and error).</p>

                    <b>Mechane Learning</b>subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computer systems to learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed.<br> Instead of using hard-coded rules, ML algorithms analyze large datasets to find patterns, make predictions, and perform tasks, getting better over time as they are exposed to more data.
